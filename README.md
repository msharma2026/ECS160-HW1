Assumptions made:
-Assumed C and C++ were to be separated repos
-Assumed we only needed to save 1 repo from each language as in Part C
-Assumed for a repo to be considered as a valid candidate of a language, it had to be the majority language used in the repo
-Assumed that if the repo had build files alongside source code, we assumed that it wasnâ€™t a tutorial or documentation repo
